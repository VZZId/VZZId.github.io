    <p>Dua Lipa's Future Nostalgia is an absolute banger of a pop album that effortlessly blends class, style, and a retro-future aesthetic with a modern twist. From the opening track, "Future Nostalgia," Lipa establishes herself as a girl-boss pop star, boldly proclaiming that she's the future of pop music.</p>
    <p>The album maintains its momentum with infectious hits like "Don't Start Now," a funky 80s disco-inspired track, and "Physical," a darker synth-pop anthem that perfectly captures the era's aerobic workout vibe. "Levitating" is another standout, with a catchy pre-chorusand a retro-future fantasy that will sweep you off your feet.</p>
    <p>While "Cool" might not be as memorable as the rest of the album, tracks like "Hallucinate" showcase Lipa's impressive vocal range and hit every beat they aim for. "Love Again" unexpectedly combines 80s TV thriller strings with modern pop sensibilities, while "Break My Heart" delivers another funky bassline and serves as the narrative climax of the album.</p>
    <p>"Good In Bed" is a hot and steamy track that subverts expectations with its juxtaposition of a sexy dance track and suggestive lyrics about an abusive relationship. The album concludes with "Boys Will Be Boys," which explores the double standards women face, perfectly aligning with Lipa's established persona. However, it's one of the weaker songs on the album.</p>
    <p>Overall, "Future Nostalgia" is a cohesive and innovative pop album that delivers a captivating narrative, a consistent tone, and an impressive final score of 9/10.</p>
